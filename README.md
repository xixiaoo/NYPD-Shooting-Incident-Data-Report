# NYPD-Shooting-Incident-Data-Report
This project will analyze NYPD shooting incidence data to assess the safety of New York City. The name of the dataset is called NYPD Shotting Incident Data(Historic). The source of the dataset: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/nypd-shooting-incident-data-historic. This dataset is a record of every shooting incident that occurred in NYC from 2006 to 2022 and provided by City of New York. My research questions are: Are all areas of Brooklyn dangerous? Is Manhattan a safer area? What time should you not be out in New York City?
