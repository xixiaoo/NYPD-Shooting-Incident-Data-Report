# NYPD-Shooting-Incident-Data-Report
This project will analyze NYPD shooting incidence data to assess the safety of New York City. The NYPD
shooting incidence dataset that we use is accessible on data.gov. This dataset is a breakdown of every
shooting incident that occurred in NYC from 2006 to 2022. My research questions are: Are all areas of
Brooklyn dangerous? Is Manhattan a safer area? What time should you not be out in New York City?
