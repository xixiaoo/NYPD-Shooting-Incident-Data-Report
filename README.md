# NYPD-Shooting-Incident-Data-Report
This project will analyze NYPD shooting incidence data to assess the safety of New York City. The NYPD
shooting incidence dataset that we use is accessible on data.gov. This dataset is a breakdown of every
shooting incident that occurred in NYC from 2006 to 2022. My research questions are: Are all areas of
Brooklyn dangerous? Is Manhattan a safer area? What time should you not be out in New York City?

# Description of the data - NYPD Shooting Incident Data (Historic):
This is a breakdown of every shooting incident that occurred in NYC going back to 2006 through the end
of the previous calendar year. This data is manually extracted every quarter and reviewed by the Office of
Management Analysis and Planning before being posted on the NYPD website. Each record represents a
shooting incident in NYC and includes information about the event, the location and time of occurrence. In
addition, information related to suspect and victim demographics is also included. This data can be used by
the public to explore the nature of shooting/criminal activity. Please refer to the attached data footnotes
for additional information about this dataset.
